### General

A simple tic-tac-toe QML example.

Created mostly to improve QML skills.

Also demonstrates the usage of the new Qt 6 bindable properties.

### Building

The example is initially created using the features from Qt 6 dev branch before Qt 6.1 release. The only new feature used here is the bindable properties. Most probably Qt 6.1 would be fine to compile and run it correctly.
